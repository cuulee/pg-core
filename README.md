# pg-core

PostgreSQL Core Driver.

Based on work by [Brian Carlson](https://github.com/brianc), it is an integration
assembly of [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) with its core packages
that is self-sufficient and independent of the original work. 

The project's goal is improved support with timely updates and bug fixes.
